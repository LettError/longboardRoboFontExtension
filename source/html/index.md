## Introduction

**Monty Python** (also known as **The Pythons**) were a British surreal comedy group who created their sketch comedy show *Monty Python's Flying Circus*, which first aired on the BBC in 1969. A self-contained comedy team responsible for both writing and performing their work, the Pythons had creative control which allowed them to experiment with form and content, discarding rules of television comedy.

The film opens with a [credit sequence](http://youtu.be/djKPvXDwXcs) that becomes increasingly ridiculous, first becoming laden with strange `pseudo-Swedish commentary` about moose, and eventually being replaced with flashy titles in which everyone's name has been changed to something involving llamas.
