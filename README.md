# Longboard

![LongBoard UI](screen_20241102_A.png)

Longboard draws previews of the current designspace in the glyph window.
It is the successor to the Skateboard and Superpolator tools.

This is for RoboFont 4.5+, you need to have the [DesignspaceEditor2 extension](https://github.com/LettError/designSpaceRoboFontExtension) installed. Longboard will activate when you have a designspace open in DSE2, and a glyph edit window for one of the sources.

Use Longboard to smoothly explore the designspace in the glyph editor. A single mouse drag can manipulate as many axis values as you want. Install via RoboFontMechanic2. Check the Help menu for a page with more details.

## Thanks!

* LongBoard is **fast** and exists because of the work, support and help from [Frederik Berlaen](https://github.com/sponsors/typemytype) and [Tal Leming](https://github.com/sponsors/typesupply)
* Roberto Arista also worked on an earlier edition of this project.
* GitHub Sponsors who make the development of open, shared tools like this possible. In the small industry of type design, that makes a huge difference. You, or the company you work for, can sponsor open source type design tools like this. [My sponsor page is here.](https://github.com/sponsors/letterror)
* And all Skateboard ðŸ›¹ and Superpolator ![Superolator icon, sorta.](longboardIcon_icon.png) for your support, feedback and patience!
